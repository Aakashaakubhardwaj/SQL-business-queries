# SQL-business-queries
Project Overview:
In this project, you will analyze a fictional music database using SQL to answer business
questions and uncover insights related to customers, sales, and music genres. This is an
opportunity to apply your SQL skills, including joins, grouping, filtering, sorting, and using CTEs
and window functions for advanced queries.
Dataset Structure:
Assume the database has the following tables:
1. employee: Contains details of employees, including their job title and seniority levels.
2. invoice: Contains all invoices with billing information.
3. customer: Contains customer data, such as first and last names and contact
information.
4. invoice_line: Detailed information on each item within an invoice.
5. track: Details of each track, including genre and duration.
6. album: Contains information on music albums.
7. artist: Information on artists.
8. genre: Information on genres.
Each table has relevant fields like customer_id, invoice_id, track_id, artist_id, etc., for joining
tables.
